# DoHex - Data Oriented Hexagonal Architecture  

Over a decade, we are continuously reviving a particular style of software architecture with different names ,interpretations and nuances. Ports And Adapters, Hexagonal Architecture [^1], Onion Architecture [^2], Clean Architecture[^3] all circle around the same concept.

It will simplify designing and developing highly maintainable , testable, scalable 

## Hexagonal Architecture 

### Philosophy  

> The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I actually control.  
> -- Epictetus

This is one of the most important and profound concepts in Stoicism. The dichotomy of control is the Stoic idea of separating things that are within our control, and things that are outside of our control.   

Hexagonal Architecture has the same idea, we must separate our application code (within our control), and IO Devices (outside of our control).

*App and outside world (IO Devices)*  

Our application does not know anything about IO Devices and should not depend on them.  

### Implementation   

> Hexagonal Architecture, allows an application to equally be driven by users, programs, automated test or batch scripts, and to be developed and tested in isolation from its eventual run-time devices and databases.
> -- Alistair Cockburn  

![Application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alicemunsal/dohex/master/diagrams/1-Hex.png)

This is our application written in TypeScript and driven by a test. It uses in memory repository to save users.

"addUser" is the only **Use Case** of our application. The use case has a **Business Logic** that checks whether name is empty and save this user to the repository.   

We can build our entire use cases with all business logic inside, using only unit tests. We don't need databases or external interfaces or UI. We can then add the infrastructure elements and other things necessary to make it a functional application.  

Our test, the **Driving Adapter** calls our application use cases. We can swap it with a CLI application or  a REST service.  Similarly we can swap our **Driven Adapter** with the MongoDB, PostgreSQL or a Web Service call. We can do that without modifying application's source code. This is an example for the Open-Closed Principle[^4] of the SOLID acronym; "software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification".
