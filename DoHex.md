## DoHex - Data Oriented Hexagonal Architecture 

### Intro

Over a decade, we are continuously reviving a particular style of software architectural pattern with different names ,interpretations and nuances. Ports And Adapters, Hexagonal Architecture [1], Onion Architecture [2], Clean Architecture[3] all circle around the same concept.  
 
I will present ...simplified thinking... practical variations of this concept
Consistent and simple design and development strategy for

#### Dichotomy of Control

> *The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I actually control.*  
> — Epictetus. Discourses. II.5  

This concept within Stoic philosophy is referred to as the Dichotomy of Control (“DOC”), the understanding of what is and what is not within our control, and it is one of the most important tenets of the philosophy.
