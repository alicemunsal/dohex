## DoHex - Data Oriented Hexagonal Architecture 

### Intro

Over a decade, we are continuously reviving a particular style of software architectural pattern with different names ,interpretations and nuances. Ports And Adapters, Hexagonal Architecture [1], Onion Architecture [2], Clean Architecture[3] all circle around the same concept.  
 
10 yıldan fazladır, Ports And Adapters, Hexagonal Architecture [1], Onion Architecture [2], Clean Architecture[3] gibi farklı isimlerle karşımıza çıkan bu yazılım mimarisinin yeni bir yorumunu tekrar sunmak istiyorum.
Amaçlarım:
* Tahtaya çizilen mimari diagramlarla project structure ı arasındaki boşluğu kapatmak.

### Project Structure

### Object Oriented Programming
